# SURF 2023
## Welcome!
This repository was created during my SURF internship at Caltech in 2023! 
@AlexisRenchon is my mentor for my SURF internship :+1: & we'll do something great together this summer! :star_struck:

Below is a short poem I wrote when I was stressed about my finals weeks ago - hope you enjoy it!

*Humans,*
in debt
`rgb(9, 105, 218)` to imagination 
~~crawling back to
the womb~~
of the universe
and, I
**should've become
an _Art major
